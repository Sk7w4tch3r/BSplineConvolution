# BSplineConvolution

Interactive BSpline Convolution interface.

1. Draw your signal on the top left panel, and the kernel in the top right panel.
2. Use left and right arrow keys to slide the kernel over the signal function, and convolve the kernel over the signal.

* You can change the degree of BSpline by up and down arrow keys respectively, but make sure that degree is less than the number of control points.
